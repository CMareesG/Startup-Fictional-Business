                Blockchain technology is a decentralized and distributed ledger system that securely records and verifies transactions across a network of computers. It operates on a consensus mechanism, ensuring transparency and immutability. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, forming a chain of blocks. This innovation enables trustless and tamper-resistant systems, as every participant has a synchronized and unalterable copy of the entire ledger. Blockchain finds applications in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, smart contracts, supply chain management, and more, offering a transparent, efficient, and secure solution to traditional centralized databases.</p>

            <p>The MERN stack is a powerful and popular technology stack for building web applications. MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. Express.js is a back-end web application framework for Node.js, facilitating server-side development. React.js is a front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces, offering a dynamic and efficient way to create interactive components. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that executes server-side code, enabling a unified JavaScript language across the entire application. Together, the MERN stack provides a seamless, end-to-end solution for developing modern and scalable web applications.</p>
